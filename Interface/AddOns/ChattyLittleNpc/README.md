# Chatty Little NPC

Dive deeper into your game with the AI Voiceover Chatty Little NPC Addon. This addon enriches your gameplay by enhancing text-based quest dialogues with pre-recorded, AI-generated voiceovers. Featuring two main voices, it provides a straightforward yet effective auditory enhancement to your game, focusing on clarity and immersive storytelling.

## Key Features

- **Dual Voice Narration**: Experience most dialogues in a primary voice with occasional use of a secondary voice to describe scenery.
- **Seamless Integration**: Installs easily and syncs automatically with new and existing quests, activating AI-voiced dialogues without any additional setup.
- **Patch Updates**: Will be updated alongside game patches to include voiceovers for new quests, ensuring consistency and freshness in your gameplay experience. At the end of expansion, all the quest voiceovers for that expansion will be grouped into expansion-specific data packs.
- **Quality Audio**: Enjoy clear and well-produced voiceovers that add a significant layer of immersion to your gaming sessions.

Ideal for gamers looking to enrich their narrative experience without complex modifications, the AI Voiceover Quest Dialog Addon brings your gameâ€™s stories to life with simplicity and style.

## Future Plans

- (DONE) What I would like to do in the future is to re-generate the voiceovers so that male and female NPCs would use different narrator voices;
- (DONE) Add the handling for all types of texts (gossip, quest description, quest progression, quest completion, quest greeting), so that npcs would really be chatty;
- (DONE) Add mechanism to collect texts while playing the game and later generate (or regenerate) new or missing voiceovers;
- (In Progress) Generate voiceovers for different races and body types so that different types of npcs would feel distinct.
